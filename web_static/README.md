The web static part of the AirBnB clone will be the front-end of the Application/Project it will be written in HTML and CSS


WEB STATIC 
learn HTML/CSS.
create the HTML of your application.
create template of each object.



WEB FRAMEWORK - Templating
create your first web server in Python.
make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database.



RESTful API
expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface.
manipulate your objects via a RESTful API.


BACKGROUND CONTEXT
Web static, what?
Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:
        Create simple HTML static pages
        Style guide
        Fake contents
        No Javascript
        No data loaded from anything
During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.

Before starting, please fork or clone the repository AirBnB_clone from your partner if you were not the owner of the previous project.
